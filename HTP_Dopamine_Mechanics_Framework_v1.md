HTP Dopamine Mechanics Framework (v1)

A simple model explaining human motivation and progress using dopamine as a measurable system.

Core Principle

Humans do not crave results. Humans crave progress. Dopamine = the signal of improvement, even if tiny (e.g., +0.1 STR IRL).

Mechanics

Micro-Progress Units (MPU)
Any small improvement triggers dopamine:

+1 push-up

+0.1 kg lift

+1 minute focus

+1% cleaner habit Small gains → stable motivation loop.

Visible Progress = Power
Progress only matters if seen. Tracking = multiplier. Examples:

graphs

streaks

stats

logs

habit meters Dopamine = “I moved forward.”

Real-Life RPG System
AI can act as IRL “HUD”:

detect behavior

measure actions

generate micro-stats (+0.1 STR, +0.05 Discipline) This creates gamified progression → constant motivation.

Progress Loop
Action → Small improvement → Dopamine → Motivation → Next action. Self-sustaining. Simple. Universal.

Why it Works
Because dopamine is:

not happiness

not pleasure

a prediction engine for progress When progress is clear → brain upgrades motivation.

Applications
Fitness

Study

Skill learning

Productivity

Therapy

Game design

AI coaching

Behavioral change

Anywhere humans move → dopamine tracks the movement.

Notes

Works cross-culture, cross-industry.

Universal framework for motivation design.

Extremely implementable by AI systems.

High compatibility with gamified IRL systems.
